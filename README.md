1) Prep the data in order to be ready to be fed to a model. Look for missing, null, NaN records.
Find outliers.
Transform data – all entries should be numeric.
2) List all types of data, numeric, categorical,...
3) Perform EDA on data
Utilize both:
 Classic approach in EDA (Pandas, Numpy libraries)
 The TFDV (TensorFlow Data Validation) module with the powerful graphical statistics
generated (apache beam library...)
Present dependencies and correlations among the various features in the data. List the most variables (Feature Importance) that will affect the target label.
4) Be aware of the time-window selection for the data.
March 2020 was when COVID19 pandemic broke up in the US.
Needless to say, every industry and business initiatives were impacted drastically. Starting March 2020, the NYC Taxi industry has established a ‘new normal’.
